# Data-and-Code-A2-B-Alvaro
This is my repository for the final assignment for Working With Data and Code A2!

**How to Run Animation and Song
**
1. Ensure the latest version of Processing is installed on your device
2. Next to 'A2_final' click the link titled 'Processing File'
3. Import the '.pde' file into the Processing Application
4. Enjoy!

KEY NOTE! -
If the 'A2_final' project does not run, please use the 'A2_No_Sound' file. (There have been some issues with the audio playing, it is still a prototype with issues to be resolved in the future!). You can then listen to the TunePad mp.3 file whilst engaging with the animation for similar effect! You can also listen to the song on TunePad directly, using the link provided here:
